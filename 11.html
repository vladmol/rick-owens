<b>Rick Owens</b>(Richard Saturnino Owens) was born in California in 1962. The fashion designer grew up in a conservative Catholic family. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles and continued his studies at the College of Art and Design. Rick himself describes his childhood as quite traditional for children of the 60s and 70s.

<i>"I am a Los Angeles cliche. I had a conservative, controlled childhood, and then it got as out of control as I could handle. As a result, I realized that control is necessary and I like it. This is the story of my generation: kids who were over-looked after and then became drug addicts and alcoholics before finding themselves."</i>

Owens learned how to decorate fabrics and create patterns. However, he dropped out of college after two years to start working with sportswear brands. In 1994, Rick founded his eponymous fashion house, Rick Owens, and sold designs exclusively at the Charles Gallay concept store in Los Angeles. With skin-tight leather jackets, knitted tank tops, asymmetrical skirts and trousers, the designer has created a separate dark world of fashion. His dark gaze and long black hair complemented the image of the punk fashion industry.
